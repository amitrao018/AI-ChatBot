AI Chat Assistant with Feedback
Overview
This is a ReactJS-based web application that allows users to interact with an AI model. Users can provide feedback during the conversation and after it ends, including thumbs up/down reactions to responses, a rating out of 5, and subjective feedback. Past conversations can be revisited, and feedback can be viewed and filtered. The app also allows toggling between light and dark modes.

Features
Chat with AI: Users can initiate and engage in a conversation with the AI.
Feedback Mechanism: Users can:
Like or dislike individual AI responses (thumbs up/down on hover).
Provide a rating out of 5 at the end of the conversation.
Offer subjective feedback on the conversation.
View Past Conversations: Users can revisit past conversations and view the feedback provided for each.
Feedback Overview: All feedback points are displayed in a table, with filtering and sorting options based on rating.
Light/Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for better user experience.
Sample Data
The app uses a custom JSON file to mock the AI model's responses for each user question.

Sample JSON Format:
json
Copy code
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the capital of France?",
      "answer": "The capital of France is Paris."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the largest ocean?",
      "answer": "The largest ocean is the Pacific Ocean."
    }
  ]
}

Technical Choices
ReactJS: Chosen for its flexibility in building dynamic UIs and its ability to manage state efficiently.
Material-UI: Used to provide a consistent and responsive design, improving the overall user experience.
Context API: Implemented for managing global state, including the chat history, feedback, and theme toggling.
Local Storage: Used to persist past conversations and user feedback so that users can revisit them later.
Custom JSON File: Mocked AI responses for simplicity and to avoid backend dependencies during development.
Design Choices
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for mobile and desktop views to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
Feedback Panel: The feedback options are easily accessible and non-intrusive, appearing when users hover over AI responses.
Light/Dark Mode: A toggleable theme was implemented for better accessibility and user preference.
Trade-offs
Simplified Data: Due to time constraints, the AI model's responses are mocked from a static JSON file instead of using a live backend API.
Limited Filtering Options: The feedback overview table provides basic filtering, but additional complex filtering (e.g., by keywords) could be added with more time.
Basic UX/UI: While functional, some elements could be further polished for a more polished user experience.
Future Improvements
Backend Integration: Integrate with a backend API to generate dynamic AI responses.
Improved Filtering: Implement more advanced filtering and sorting options for feedback.
User Authentication: Allow users to log in and track conversations over multiple sessions.
Deployed Application
The deployed version of the application is available on Vercel.
